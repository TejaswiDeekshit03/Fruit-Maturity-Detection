# Fruit-Maturity-Detection

We recently worked on this deep learning model. We created a model to detect the maturity level of the fruit through an image. We made our own dataset using 5 classes (five different fruits), categorizing them into 3 types: Unripe, Fresh, and Rot. We trained the model with different architectures and got the best accuracy for CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) architecture. We tried changing the number of dense layers, convolutional layers, max-pooling layers and epochs values to gain maximum accuracy. We received an accuracy of 90.24% after testing the model.
